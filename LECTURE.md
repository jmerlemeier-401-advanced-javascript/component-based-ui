### Code Challenge

- Write a funcion that takes in a linked list and returns a new linked list with its nodes reversed.

  - If you have completed this challenge previously: Let them know.
  - CLARIFYING QUESTIONS! Ask can I use built-in methods? Should I build methods from scratch using classes? What can I assume about nodes? Would you like me to modify the linked list in-place?
  - IDENTIFY proper inputs and outputs. "I would expect the output to look like this."
    - Pictures
    - Illustrations of data structures and using callouts to operations that need to occur.
  - Algorithm (talk with your interviewer)
    - Enumerated list of all the steps your solution will use?
    - Concise
    - EFFICIENCY (Big(O) time and space). Space and Time complexity.
    - You can say, "This is what I know, this is where I am a little stuck. Is there something you would recommend here."
  - Pseudo Code: Build out your algorithm with variables, methods, ect. Very Explicit.
  - Code: produce syntactically correct code.
  - Testing and edge cases for the end.
